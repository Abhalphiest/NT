\subsection{Quadratic Residues}
\newtheorem*{quadraticresiduedefinition}{Quadratic Residue}
\begin{quadraticresiduedefinition}
Let $a$ and $n$ be integers such that $(a,n) = 1$. If the congruence
	$$x^2 \equiv a \pmod n$$
has solutions $x$, then $a$ is a \textit{quadratic residue} of $n$. If there are no such solutions, then $a$ is a \textit{quadratic non-residue} modulo $n$.
\end{quadraticresiduedefinition}

\par It should be noted that the condition $(a,n) = 1$ allows us to consider only the so-called \textit{primitive} residue classes modulo $n$, or those classes that are relatively prime to $n$ when searching for quadratic residues. 

\par We now have a result related to quadratic residues.
 \newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem}
 \begin{theorem}
 The product of two quadratic residues $a$ and $b$ modulo $n$ is always a quadratic residue of $n$, and the product of two quadratic non-residues $\alpha$ and $\beta$ modulo $n$ is always a quadratic non-residue.
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
 Suppose that two integers $a$ and $a$ both relatively prime to $n$ are quadratic residues modulo $n$. Thus $x^2 \equiv a
  \pmod n$ and $y^2 \equiv b \pmod n$ for some $x$ and $y$. Because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime to $n$, we can say
   $x^2y^2 = (xy)^2 \equiv ab \pmod n$ , which gives us our first result.
 \par Now suppose there is an $x$ such that  $x^2 \equiv \alpha \pmod n$, but no $y$ such that  $y^2 \equiv \beta \pmod n$,
  and there exists some $z$ such that $z^2 \equiv \alpha\beta \pmod n$. This gives us $z^2 \equiv x^2 \beta \pmod n$ , and thus 
  $\left( \frac{z}{x} \right)^2 \equiv \beta \pmod n$, which contradicts our assumption that $\beta$ is a non-quadratic residue.
 \end{proof}
 
 \par Note that we do not address the product of two non-residues.
 
 
\end{quadraticresiduedefinition}
\subsubsection{Legendre's Symbol and Jacobi's Symbol}
We define Legendre's Symbol $\left( \frac{a}{p} \right)$ as a symbol given the value $1$ if $a$ is a quadratic residue of $p$ and the value $-1$ if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue of $p$, where $p$ is a prime.
