\subsection{Quadratic Residues}
\newtheorem*{quadraticresiduedefinition}{Quadratic Residue}
\begin{quadraticresiduedefinition}
Let $a$ and $n$ be integers such that $(a,n) = 1$. If the congruence
	$$x^2 \equiv a \pmod n$$
has solutions $x$, then $a$ is a \textit{quadratic residue} of $n$. If there are no such solutions, then $a$ is a \textit{quadratic non-residue} modulo $n$.
\end{quadraticresiduedefinition}

\par It should be noted that the condition $(a,n) = 1$ allows us to consider only the so-called \textit{primitive} residue classes modulo $n$, or those classes that are relatively prime to $n$ when searching for quadratic residues. 

\par We now have a result related to quadratic residues.
 \newtheorem*{theorem}{Theorem}
 \begin{theorem}
 The product of two quadratic residues $a$ and $b$ modulo $n$ is always a quadratic residue of $n$, and the product of two quadratic non-residues $\alpha$ and $\beta$ modulo $n$ is always a quadratic non-residue.
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
 Suppose that two integers $a$ and $a$ both relatively prime to $n$ are quadratic residues modulo $n$. Thus $x^2 \equiv a
  \pmod n$ and $y^2 \equiv b \pmod n$ for some $x$ and $y$. Because $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime to $n$, we can say
   $x^2y^2 = (xy)^2 \equiv ab \pmod n$ , which gives us our first result.
 \par Now suppose there is an $x$ such that  $x^2 \equiv \alpha \pmod n$, but no $y$ such that  $y^2 \equiv \beta \pmod n$,
  and there exists some $z$ such that $z^2 \equiv \alpha\beta \pmod n$. This gives us $z^2 \equiv x^2 \beta \pmod n$ , and thus 
  $\left( \frac{z}{x} \right)^2 \equiv \beta \pmod n$, which contradicts our assumption that $\beta$ is a non-quadratic residue.
 \end{proof}
 
 \par Note that we do not address the product of two non-residues.
 
 
\subsubsection{Legendre's Symbol, Euler's Criterion, and Jacobi's Symbol}
We define Legendre's Symbol $\left( \frac{a}{p} \right)$ as a symbol given the value $1$ if $a$ is a quadratic residue of $p$ and the value $-1$ if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue of $p$, where $p$ is a prime.
\par It is, of course, possible to compute Legendre's Symbol directly by trying every congruence class of $p$, but luckily there is a more elegant way, given by Euler:

\newtheorem*{eulercriterion}{Euler's Criterion}
\begin{eulercriterion}
If $(a,p)  = 1$ and $p$ is an odd prime, then 
	$$ \left( \frac{a}{p} \right)  \equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \pmod p$$
\end{eulercriterion}
\begin{proof}
The result can be broken into two results:
	$$a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod p \text{ if and only if } a \text{ is a quadratic residue of } p$$
	$$\text{ and }$$
	$$a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod p \text{ if and only if } a \text{ is a quadratic non-residue of } p$$
	
\par We begin with the second of these. Let $a$ be a quadratic non-residue of a prime $p$, and $b$ be some natural number less than $p$. $bx \equiv a$ has a unique solution $x = b^{-1}$, because $(b,p) = 1$. However, $b \not \equiv b^{-1} \pmod p$, because otherwise $b^2 \equiv a \pmod p$ contradicts the assumption that $a$ is a quadratic non-residue. Thus all natural numbers less than $p$ can be paired into $\frac{p-1}{2}$ pairs $(m,n)$ such that $mn \equiv a \pmod p$. 
\par Multiplying these pairs together, we have a product of  $\frac{p-1}{2}$ integers all equivalent to $a$ modulo $p$, which will be equivalent to $a^\frac{p-1}{2}$ modulo $p$ and  equal to $(p-1)!$. By Wilson's Theorem, we also have $(p-1)! \equiv -1 \pmod p$, and so when $a$ is a quadratic non-residue of $p$, $a^\frac{p-1}{2} \equiv -1 \pmod p$.
\par Now let $a$ be such that $a^\frac{p-1}{2} \equiv -1 \pmod p$. By Wilson's Theorem, $a^\frac{p-1}{2} \equiv (p-1)! \pmod p$, and thus this implies that the product of all natural  numbers $b < p$ produce $\frac{p-1}{2}$ factors equivalent to $a$. If any $b$ exists such that $bx \equiv a \pmod p$ has its unique solution $x$ equivalent to $b$, then $b$ will not be able to form a product equivalent to $a$ when paired with any other factor of $(p-1)!$, which is a contradiction. Thus there is no $b$ such that $b^2 \equiv a \pmod p$, and $a$ is a quadratic non-residue.
\par Now let $a$ be a quadratic residue of $p$. We can pick a natural number $b < p$ such that $b^2 \equiv a \pmod p$, and thus $ b^{p-1} \equiv a^\frac{p-1}{2} \pmod p$. By Fermat's Theorem, we have $ a^\frac{p-1}{2} \equiv 1 \pmod p$.
\par Finally, we examine the case that  $a^\frac{p-1}{2} \equiv 1 \pmod p$ for some arbitrary $a$ relatively prime to $p$. Let $b$ be a primitive root modulo $p$ such that $a$ can be written as $b^j$ for some $j$. From this we have $b^{j \cdot \frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod p$. Because the least power of $b$ that is equivalent to $1$ modulo $p$ is $p-1$, $p -1 \mid j \cdot \frac{p-1}{2}$. Thus $j$ must be even, and $\frac{j}{2}$ is an integer. Thus we have that $(b^{\frac{j}{2}})^2 \equiv a \pmod p$, and thus $a$ must be a quadratic residue.
	
\end{proof}

\par You may have noticed that the Legendre Symbol is only defined for a prime $p$. We define an analogue for composites, \textit{Jacobi's Symbol}, $\left( \frac{a}{n} \right)$, as $\prod_i \left( \frac{a}{p_i} \right) ^{\alpha_i}$ for $n$ an odd integer, $(a,n) = 1$, and $n = \prod_i p_i^{\alpha_i}$. 

\par Recalling that we never addressed the case of the product of two quadratic non residues, it makes intuitive sense that the Jacobi symbol occasionally incorrectly takes the value $1$ for a quadratic non-residue, given it is the product of two non-residues. However, it never incorrectly identifies a quadratic residue.  Thus it can be used to quickly determine that something is not a quadratic residue modulo $n$, but cannot prove something as a quadratic residue mod $n$.

\subsection{A Few Small Results}
\begin{theorem}
If $k$ is the least positive integer such that $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod n$, $a^j \equiv 1 \pmod n$, and $k < j$, then $k \mid j$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $k$ be the least power such that $a^k \equiv 1 \pmod n$. $j = k + m$, with $m \in \mathbb N$. if $k \nmid m$, then $m = qk+ r$, $ 0 < r < m$, and $j = (q+1)k + r$. However, $a^j = a^{(q+1)k}a^r \equiv a^r \equiv 1 \pmod n$ contradicts the minimality of $k$. Thus $k$ must divide $j$.
\end{proof}
