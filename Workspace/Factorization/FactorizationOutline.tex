%%  use /par to start a new paragraph, // for a simple line break.

%%  You must use labelling commands, e.g. \label, \ref,
%%  \bibitem, and \cite to refer to sections of your document, such as
%%  see Section~\ref{sectionname}, see Figure~\ref{figurename}, or bibliography entries,
%%  such as see~\cite{citationname}.  Otherwise the look of the numbers, and sometimes the numbers
%%  themselves, will get messed up.
