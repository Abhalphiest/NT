%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%  use /par to start a new paragraph, // for a simple line break.
%%
%%  You must use labelling commands, e.g. \label, \ref,
%%  \bibitem, and \cite to refer to sections of your document, such as
%%  see Section~\ref{sectionname}, see Figure~\ref{figurename}, or bibliography entries,
%%  such as see~\cite{citationname}.  Otherwise the look of the numbers, and sometimes the numbers
%%  themselves, will get messed up.

%% Matrix Notation - don't know if we'll end up using it, but it is kind of strange so here's an example
%%

%% Figures - this is how you use a figure made from Mathematica or Maple in .eps format. The .eps file must be in the same directory
%% .eps file must be pure ascii mode, no preview, no thumbnail
%% I have both maple and mathematica if we need figures, so don't bother to go and buy a license.
