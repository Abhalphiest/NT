 * Description:	A parallelization of the FermatBig program, using the OpenMPI
 *		library to compute on multiple CPU cores in parallel. This 
 *		implementation focuses heavily on optimization and flexibility
 *		in order to get a true feel for the computational viability of
 *		Fermat's Theorem based algorithms for primality testing.
